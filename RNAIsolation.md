##*Equipment & Supplies*  
  * IEC Refrigerated Microcentrifuge or any microcentrifuge, preferably refrigerated  
  * NanoDrop or Spectrophotometer  
  * RNAse Free Microcentrifuge Tubes  

##*Reagents & Buffers*  
  * Tri Reagent (Sigma) or TriZol (Life Technologies)  
  * Chloroform  
  * Isopropanol (99+%)  
  * Ethanol (75%, Ice Cold)  
  * RNAse Free Water

##*RNA Isolation*  

1. Use 5-10 x 10e6 cells per microfuge tube (per 1mL of Tri Reagent), pellet the cells and resuspend in 1mL of Tri Reagent, lyse cells through repeated pipetting   (cell sample may be frozen at –70C for up to 1 month after lysing). Centrifuge the homogenate at 12,000g for 10minutes at 4C to remove high molecular weight DNA. The supernatant will contain the RNA. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. 

2. Let sample stand at RT for 5 minutes. Add 200ul of chloroform per mL of Tri Reagent. Cover sample tightly, shake vigorously for 15 seconds and let stand for 2-15 minutes at RT. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 15m at 4C. This will separate the sample into 3 phrases; the upper aqueous phase contains the RNA. 

3. Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and add 500ul of isopropanol (99+%) per mL of Tri Reagent used, mix and let stand for 5-10 minutes at RT. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4C. the RNA will precipitate and form a pellet on side and bottom of tube. 

4. Remove the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet by adding 1 mL of 75% very cold ethanol per 1mL of Tri Reagent used. Centrifuge at 12000g for 10 minutes at 4C. Two washes, try to only rinse the pellet and not disrupt it. (if the pellet floats centrifuge again at 12,000g, sample may be stored in ethanol for 1 week at 4C or 1 year at –70C). 

5. Briefly dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 minutes, do not dry completely. Add an appropriate amount (35ul) of clean water to sample and mix by pipetting to dissolve the RNA. Can be done at 55-60C to facilitate dissolution, or pre-heat water. 

6. Aliquot samples in volumes to be used for RT PCR to eliminate the need to freeze and thaw stock tubes. Aliquot a sample for analysis; 1.5ul RNA to 13.5ul H2O for nanodrop. 

7. Final prep of RNA should have 260/280 ratio of 1.7 typical yields from cells (ugRNA/10e6 cells) 5-15ug. Wavelength used is 260nm using the formula of one A260 unit equals an RNA concentration of 40ug/mL. 

##*Notes:*

  * JW: I have been using 15 -20 million cells for RT-PCR  
  
  * Keep samples on ice unless otherwise stated. Keep work area and equipment free of RNAse. 

  * To check integrity of RNA: run sample on 1% TBE agarose gel with 0.5 ug/ml EtBr. Calculate 1ug of RNA and run same concentration for each lane.  Run at 100V for 1 hour or so until bands are separated. Should see two bands: 18s and 28s ribosomal RNA. Run a positive control of intact RNA if available.
