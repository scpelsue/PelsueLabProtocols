## **Pelsue Lab Standard Buffer Recipes:**

**PBS**
To ~500 mL of Miliq H2O add the following:
80g NaCl
2g KCl
14.4g Na2HPO4O (dibasic anhydrous)
2.4g KH2PO4O (monobasic anhydrous)
Check the pH- using either NaOH or HCl pH to 7.2-7.4
Bring volume to 1000mL (Miliq H2O)
Autoclave

**Electroporation Transfection Buffer**
To ~ 200 mL of Sterile H2O add the following:
.008g CaCl2
4.474 KCl
12.5 mL ofHEPES
0.381g EGTA (pH 7.6)
0.238g MgCl2 
0.768g Glutathione
.005 K2HPO4/KH2PO4

To prepare K2HPO4/KH2PO4:
Add 6.8g of KH2PO4  to 50 mL H2O
Add 8.71g of K2HPO4 to 50 mL H2O
Add the weak base (K2HPO4) to the weak acid (KH2PO4) until the pH is 7.6- this will take roughly 150 mL of the weak base.

Once the recipe is complete, sterile filter the solution. Aliquot in hood.
